This repository contains the project source code which needs to be configured for running react app. The code snapshots are organized in multiple branches where every branch represents a step acheived in direction to build the project.
For example, the branch step-1 holds all code snapshots for section 1 of the project. 
To see the final output just import the App component in index file of react root element and run with command "npm start"/"bun dev".
